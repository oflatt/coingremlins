Run `play_gui` on the command line:

  play_gui <host> <port> <game_id> <player_count> <index>

The <host> and <port> arguments select a server. The <game_id> plus
<player_count> arguments together select a game that multiple players
can join. Each player should choose a unique <index> between 0
(inclusive) and <player_count> (exclusive).
