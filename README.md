# Installation

Use the github releases to download a binary for your platform.

On mac, you may need to run this to convince
the system that the binary is safe to run:

```bash
xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine economancy-aarch64-macosx/
```


The server for the game isn't currently running, but you could run your own. See `server.rkt`
